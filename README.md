# NYC_AirBnB_Dataset_Analysis
I employ a well-known dataset to showcase the possibilities it offers when approached from the angles of Python, SQL, or AWS. The code is designed to exhibit a grasp of fundamental concepts rather than being overly intricate.\

Dataset can be found here: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dgomonov/new-york-city-airbnb-open-data/

The csv version is within the repository.

Folders are organized by technology being utilized most with the dataset.

The Python Demonstration Folder includes a dashboard to display all the results in the Exploratory Data Analysis notebook as well as the charts from the pricing model notebook.

The SQL Demonstration folder includes a SQL script for different queries on the data but those same queries can also be previewed
by looking at the jupyter notebook in there.

The AWS Demonstration folder includes a python script that shows conceptually how you would prepare and clean soe data before uploading it to an S3 bucket.
